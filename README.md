# Path-finder

A visual representation of labyrinth solving algorithms using common traversal algorithms such as BFS, DFS, A*.
Plus there are some basic artificial intelligence patterns like generational learning.

The project itself also provides real time solving steps implemented on the GUI. The labyrinth
consists of a starting and ending Node + treasures scattered across the field (the "AI" has to find them in order to correctly solve finish the maze).
